## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Pivotal continuously strives to learn and measure results in order to put customer
experience at the forefront of our product decisions. Data and continuous feedback
loops shape the way Pivotal builds software.

Pivotal Telemetry Collector is an automated tool that collects data from a series of 
Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) APIs found within a foundation and securely sends that 
data to Pivotal. The tool collects:

  * Configuration data from the Ops Manager API.
  * Optional certificate data from the CredHub API.
  * Optional app, task and service instance usage data from the Usage Service API.

Pivotal uses this information to do the following:

  * Improve its products and services.
  * Fix problems.
  * Advise customers on how best to deploy and use Pivotal products.
  * Provide better customer support.

The Pivotal Telemetry Collector is available for download on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-telemetry-collector/).
