This guide describes Pivotal Telemetry Collector, a stand-alone tool, and light-weight alternative
to the Pivotal Telemetry for Ops Manager tile. It can be used manually as a CLI or automated through
Concourse. The tool can be configured and automated to share product usage and consumption data with Pivotal
so that we can improve our products and services based on insights from real-world usage.
